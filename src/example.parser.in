SETUP_VARS "co,c,o"

# this is an example of a comment

# Now we will define two events. The syntax is the EVENT keyword, the RATE keyword,
# followed by a rate equation and n event equations.
# The rate equation is the the RHS of rate = f(state)
# Following this are the event equations. There should be one equation for each elment
# of the state array.
# In this case, there are 3 state varaibles. You know this because line 1 says
# the state array is co,c,o
# so there are three equations following the rate equation.
# The first equation describes a function for the first variable in the
# state array. For example, "co - 1" represents the equation co = co -1 since co is the
# first varaible listed on line 1 of this file.

EVENT RATE "24.3*(co+o)" "co - 1" "c + 1" "o + 1"
EVENT RATE "56.1+co/c" "co + 1" "c - 1" "o - 1"  # example of another type of comment
