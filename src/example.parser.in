SETUP_VARS "a,b,c"

# this is an example of a comment

# Now we will define two events. The syntax is the EVENT keyword, the RATE keyword,
# followed by a rate equation and n event equations.
# The rate equation is the the RHS of rate = f(state)
# Following this are the event equations. There should be one equation for each elment
# of the state array.
# In this case, there are 3 state varaibles. You know this because line 1 says
# the state array is a,b,c
# so there are three equations following the rate equation.
# The first equation describes a function for the first variable in the
# state array. For example, "a*b*c" represents the equation a = a*b*c since a is the
# first varaible listed on line 1 of this file.

EVENT RATE "5*(a+b)" "a*b*c" "a+b+c" "c*b-a"
EVENT RATE "c*(a+b)" "a+b*c" "a*b-c" "(a-b)*c"  # example of another type of comment
