###Introduction 

Stoched* is a platform for simulating realizations of stochastic systems modeled by rate equations. 
The Gillespie algorithm performs exact simulations. Also, more scalable approximate algorithms derived from the 
Gillespie algorithm are useful for large systems. These algorithms have historically been used to solve problems 
in molecular dynamics; today, they are applied to a wide variety of stochastic modeling problems. The platform is a 
fast, compiled code tool with an extremely simple interface aimed towards scientists with minimal programming 
experience. While other tools for stochastic modeling and simulation exist, none have non-programmer-friendly interfaces 
and few are specialized to those systems modeled by rate equations alone. We take user-friendly modeling languages 
developed for Bayesian inference (BUGS/JAGS and Stan) as guides.
