Welcome to {\bfseries stoched}, an application developed at Princeton University for modeling stochastic systems modeled by rate equations and simulating reactions from them!

Getting started information for {\bfseries stoched} (including build instructions) is located in its interior doc/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md file.

\subsubsection*{Introduction}

The platform is a fast, compiled code tool with an extremely simple interface aimed towards scientists with minimal programming experience. While other tools for stochastic modeling and simulation exist, none have non-\/programmer-\/friendly interfaces and few are specialized to those systems modeled by rate equations alone. We take user-\/friendly modeling languages developed for Bayesian inference (B\+U\+G\+S/\+J\+A\+GS and Stan) as guides.

Stoched implements the Gillespie algorithm to perform exact simulations. Also, more scalable approximate algorithms derived from the Gillespie algorithm are useful for large systems. These algorithms have historically been used to solve problems in molecular dynamics; today, they are applied to a wide variety of stochastic modeling problems.
